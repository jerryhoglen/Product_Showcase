      <h4>Our Story</h4>
      <p> To most people Two Pines was just another small town in New England but not to the people who grew up there, this was the small town where people lived off the land, where local farmers and mom and pop business has kept the town alive. This allowed
        them to focus on the important things in life like family, friends, and nature. But then it was almost taken from them. A historic farmsite was going to be sold to big business to “help modernize and bring in more jobs to the town” they said.
        The people of Two Pine wouldn’t give up without a fight and that’s how our coffee company was created.</p>
      <p>We were able to acquire the land with the promise of keeping Two Pines the sustainable beautiful place it is. A portion of our profits go directly back to Two Pines and its people. We provide a fair trade coffee that uses only the cleanest and most
        efficient machines to keep the process eco friendly. Help us continue to keep the dreams of hard-working families alive and join us for a cup of Two Pines Coffee. </p>
